# Contributing
Contributing encompasses repository specific requirements, and the global [Quipucords contribution guidelines](https://github.com/quipucords/quipucords/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Install
Before developing you'll need to install:
* [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
  * Alternatively, you can try [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman).
* And [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Docker & Mac
Setting Docker up on a Mac? Install the appropriate package and you should be good to go. To check if everything installed correctly you can try these steps.
* At a terminal prompt type

  ```
  $ docker run hello-world
  ```

### Docker & Linux
Setting Docker up on a Linux machine can include an additional convenience step. If you're having to prefix "sudo" in front of your Docker commands you can try these steps.
* [Docker postinstall documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

### Yarn
Once you've installed NodeJS you can use NPM to perform the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) install

  ```
  $ npm install yarn -g
  ```

You can also use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

  ```
  $ brew update
  $ brew install yarn
  ```

## Git process
### Commits
In an effort to continue enhancing future automation around
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) and tagging we make use of [Changelog Light](https://www.npmjs.com/package/changelog-light) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

It's required that commit messaging follow the format
```
   <type>[optional scope]: <issue number><description>
```

For Jira issues that generally looks like
```
   <type>[optional scope]: jiraPrefix-123 <description>
```

For Github issues that looks like
```
   <type>[optional scope]: issues/123 <description>
```
### Release process
The release process currently consists of
- Running `$ yarn release`
- Manually tagging the release commit

#### Release CHANGELOG updates

##### Run a CHANGELOG check
To see a recommended semver bump, and confirm what will be generated for [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)...
```shell
$ yarn release --dry-run
```

##### Run and optionally commit CHANGELOG updates
Have the tooling **automatically commit** [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) and [package.json](./package.json) updates
```shell
$ yarn release
```

OR have the tooling **only generate** [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) and [package.json](./package.json) updates
```shell
$ yarn release --commit=false
```


## Serving Content
To serve content you'll need to have Docker, Node, and Yarn installed.

If `yarn start` fails to run and produces an `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` error, try `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` before calling `yarn start` again. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/69746937 for more details.

Serving content comes in 3 variations
- `$ yarn start`, Development local run, randomized mock data. The cons to this are the randomized mock data, it gets weird.

  No credentials necessary! All data is temporary and random!

  Useful for
   - Local development against randomized mock data generated from the Quipucords API spec.

- `$ yarn start:stage`, Development local run, minimally styled/un-styled login, all while volumed into an API Docker container.

  You'll be asked for the default credentials. You should be able to update the associated database, and run actual scans.

  Useful for
   - Local development against an actual Quipucords API.

  You'll be asked for the default credentials in an un-styled login. You should be able to update the associated database, and run actual scans.
- `$ yarn start:review`, An approximation of a production build. The GUI build is compiled and tested then run against a volumed API Docker container

  You'll be asked for the default credentials. You should be able to update the associated database, and run actual scans.

  Useful for
   - Testing the GUI build, and avoiding package install problems.

## Build
### dotenv files
Our current build leverages `dotenv`, or `.env*`, files to apply environment build configuration.

There are currently build processes in place that leverage the `.env*.local` files, these files are actively applied in our `.gitignore` in order to avoid build conflicts. They should continue to remain ignored, and not be added to the repository.

Specific uses:
- `env.local`, is used for development purposes typically around displaying Redux logging
- `.env.production.local`, is used by the build to relate build information, i.e. versioning

## Testing
To test content you'll need to have Node and Yarn installed.

### Code Coverage Requirements
Updates that drop coverage below the current threshold will need to have their coverage expanded accordingly before being merged.

Settings for the Jest aspect of code coverage can be found in [package.json](./package.json). Settings for the CI reporting level of code coverage
can be found in [.codecov.yml](./.codecov.yml).

### Debugging and Testing

#### Debugging local development
You can apply overrides during local development by adding a `.env.local` (dotenv) file in the repository root directory.

Once you have made the dotenv file and/or changes, like the below "debug" flags, restart the project and the flags should be active.

*Any changes you make to the `.env.local` file should be ignored with `.gitignore`.*

##### Debugging Redux
This project makes use of React & Redux. To enable Redux console logging, within the repository root directory, add a `.env.local` (dotenv) file with the follow line
  ```
  REACT_APP_DEBUG_MIDDLEWARE=true
  ```

Once you've made the change, restart the project and console browser logging should appear.

*Any changes you make to the `.env.local` file should be ignored with `.gitignore`.*

#### Unit Testing
To run the unit tests with a watch during development you'll need to open an additional terminal instance, then run
  ```
  $ yarn test:dev
  ```

##### Updating unit test snapshots
To update snapshots from the terminal run
  ```
  $ yarn test:dev
  ```

From there you'll be presented with a few choices, one of them is "update", you can then hit the "u" key. Once the update script has run you should see additional changed files within Git, make sure to commit them along with your changes, or testing will fail.

#### Integration Testing
We run "integration-like" checks on build output as a fallback before a code release. To run the integration tests with a watch after build compilation, first run
  ```
  $ yarn build
  ```

This will compile, and then run the initial build checks. It will either succeed, or fail, depending on changes produced during development, **this is OK, and expected**.

##### Updating integration test snapshots
To update integration test snapshots from the terminal run
  ```
  $ yarn test:integration-dev
  ```

From there you'll be presented with a few choices, one of them is "update", you can then hit the "u" key. Once the update script has run you should see additional changed files within Git, make sure to commit them along with your changes, or testing will fail.

##### Checking code coverage
To check the coverage report from the terminal run
  ```
  $ yarn test
  ```

##### Code coverage failing to update?
If you're having trouble getting an accurate code coverage report, or it's failing to provide updated results (i.e. you renamed files) you can try running
  ```
  $ yarn test:clearCache
  ```

## Generated content
This repository creates, and has, some interdependency on both [Quipucords](https://github.com/quipucords/quipucords) and [Quipudocs](https://github.com/quipucords/quipudocs)

### Django templates, login and logout
In order to have GUI developer access to the login and logout aspects of [Quipucords](https://github.com/quipucords/quipucords) we house
the Django template files here [./templates/*](./templates/base.html).

#### Important!
- This templates directory is required as part of the build process. **Removing `./templates` directory will break the production build.**
- Updating the templates requires minimal understand of html, plus some minor recognition of templating languages. [If needed checkout out the Django template structure reading](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/templates/).
- We use a shell script token string replacement during the build process for the application display name. If you see **[UI_NAME]** within the templates, be aware.
- [The build script for directly manipulating the templates is here, ./scripts/post.sh](./scripts/post.sh)

### Documentation, locale and help guides
[Quipudocs](https://github.com/quipucords/quipudocs) houses our locale and help guide setup through an NPM dependency layout, [see our package.json for Quipudocs](./package.json).

#### Important!
- We do not store locale and help guide documentation with the UI repo. Any updates to those locations will be overwritten during the build process.
- To handle locale string replacement during GUI development it is important to utilize fallback strings because of this separation, that GUI code has the appearance of `t(someKey, 'my fallback string'')`.
- [The build script for directly manipulating the locale and help guides is here, ./scripts/quipudocs.js](./scripts/quipudocs.js)

### Brand build
The brand build updates aspects of the application name across the React and Django templates.
To handle a branded aspect of the build, instead of `yarn build`, run

   ```
   $ yarn build:brand
   ```

## Typical Development Workflow
1. Confirm you've installed all recommended tooling
1. Confirm the repository name has no blank spaces in it. If it does replace that blank with a dash or underscore, Docker has issues with unescaped parameter strings.
1. Confirm you've installed resources through yarn
1. Create a local dotenv file called `.env.local` and add the following contents
    ```
    REACT_APP_DEBUG_MIDDLEWARE=true
    ```
1. Make sure Docker is running
1. Open a couple of instances of Terminal and run...
    ```
    $ yarn start:stage
    ```
    and, optionally,
    ```
    $ yarn test:dev
    ```
1. Make sure your browser opened around the domain `https://localhost:5001`
1. Start developing...
